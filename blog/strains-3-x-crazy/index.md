Also known as Optimus Prime, the indica-dominant 3X Crazy is a three-way cross between OG Kush, Bubba Kush, and Granddaddy Purple. Its aroma is comprised of sweet grape, spicy pepper, and earthy notes passed on by its Bubba Kush parent. This indica will leave you sedated with soothing full-body effects, but not before a brief phase of clear-headed cerebral psychoactivity. The relaxing effects induced by 3X Crazy can be used to treat a variety of severe symptoms, some of which include pain, spasms, tension, and insomnia.Â
